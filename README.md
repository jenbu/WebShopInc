## Setup


### Database setup
You need Docker to run the database. I use Docker Desktop on Windows.
In a terminal, enter the WebShopInc folder and start the database:
```
docker-compose up
```

### UI Setup

Enter the ClientApp folder in a terminal and install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```
Start the development server by running:
```
ng serve
```

You can view the web page by going to the following address in an internet browser:
http://localhost:4200

### Back-end
Open the WebShopInc solution file and run it, I use Visual Studio for this.
